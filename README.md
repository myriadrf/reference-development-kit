### Documentation

* RFDIO Connector Specification

The Myriad-RF Radio Frequency Digital Input Output (RFDIO) connector specification defines the electrical and mechanical properties of a high speed card interface for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based carrier boards. This specification ensures interoperability between carrier (mother) boards and add-on (daughter) RF cards.

*Please note that this needs to be updated with details of the connector specification used by the micro series of boards.*

### Myriad-RF 1 module (myriadrf-1)

Hardware design files for the LMS6002-based Myriad-RF 1 RF module.

Note that there are two versions of the design: one with vias in pads, and another with them off.

### DE0-Nano Interface (de0nano-interface)

Hardware design files and firmware sources (FPGA HDL + Cypress FX2 code) for the DE0-Nano interface that is used with the original Myriad-RF 1 module.

### Zipper Interface (zipper)

This interface allows the Myriad-RF 1 to be used with FPGA development boards that have either a HSMC or FMC connector.

*Note that v1 of the hardware design was not made generally available.*

### uMyriadRF-6002 (umyriadrf-6002)

LMS6002 version of the micro form factor RF module.

### uMyriadRF-7002 (umyriadrf-7002)

LMS7002 version of the micro form factor RF module.

### MyriadRF-8001 (myriadrf-8001)

LMS8001 Companion.
